<h1>2. Planning the Confirmation Website<a class="headerlink" href="#planning-the-confirmation-website" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This document details the plans for the Confirmation Website for St. Basil Catholic Church, 2017. It will help design
the database structures and plan the whole Django program.</p>

<h2>2.1. Narrative Walkthroughs<a class="headerlink" href="#narrative-walkthroughs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<h3>2.1.1. Initial Walkthrough from WordPerfect<a class="headerlink" href="#initial-walkthrough-from-wordperfect" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Jim the Confirmation Candidate enters the St. Basil Confirmation website by clicking a link on the parish’s own website.
(Determine where.) Upon arriving at the site he is asked to login with the username and password provided to him by the
church.</p>
<p>Once he logs in he is welcomed to a page that shows the currently existing projects with checkmarks indicating his
progress through them. When he clicks on the “Continue” button he comes to the page of his next uncompleted step. He can
page backward through completed steps and perhaps edit his written out answers, but he cannot go ahead to pages he has
not finished until he has completed the ones leading up to it. He finished the last project and is now ready to start
“The Real Story of Noah.”  He clicks the “Continue” button.</p>
<p>[Alternative: Once he logs in he is welcomed to a page that shows the currently existing projects with checkmarks next
to ones he has finished and percentage of completion otherwise. He can select any project by clicking on its name.  He
clicks on the “The Real Story of Noah” which he is just beginning.]</p>
<p>Jim arrives at a page explaining what he must do, read the story of Noah in the Bible and, when he is finished, he
clicks on the “Next” button.</p>
<p>Jim arrives at a page asking him a question or requests his point of view or otherwise asks him to write something.
Sometimes questions may be multiple choice or even True or False. He responds and clicks on the “Submit” button.</p>
<p>He is brought to the next page which may or may not give him feedback on the previous question and presents a new
question or activity. Jim… [This is where the WordPerfect file ends.]</p>

<div class="section" id="miguel">
<h3>2.1.2. Miguel<a class="headerlink" href="#miguel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Miguel, a St. Basil Confirmation candidate, decides to visit the parish’s Confirmation candidate website. Upon entering
the site he sees a red banner heading with “St. Basil Confirmation Candidate Website” at the top with a Holy Spirit
image to the left. Below that is a form asking for his username and password. He enters these as they were given to him
in an e-mail, or possibly even via regular mail. When he clicks the Submit button he enters the site proper.</p>
<p>The first page he sees lists a set of activities he can accomplish. Since this is his first time at the site, they all
indicate that he is 0% finished with that activity.</p>
<p>He decides to select the activity labelled “Noah: The REAL Story” and enters the opening page of that activity. This
first page simply tells him to read a passage from the bible (there is a link on the page pointing to an explanation of
how to find passages in the bible). It instructs him to click on the “Finished Reading” button only after he has
completed reading the passage. Behind the scenes the computer has stored the date and time he first entered the page and
will record the date and time he clicks the “Finished Reading” button. This can be used to help ensure the candidates
really read the passage.</p>
<p>Miguel leaves the page and goes to his bible to read the passage. Afterwards he returns to the website and enters the
“Noah: The REAL Story” activity again. It opens to the first page, the one with the “Finished Reading” button, which he
now clicks.</p>
<p>The next page asks him to read and simplify one of the footnotes in his bible. It has a box with the instructions and
a text entry box for him to enter his answer. When he clicks “Submit” his response is stored (though he can edit it
later) and he proceeds to the third page.</p>
<p>This one is simpler. It asks him a multiple choice question and allows him to select one of the answers. He is tired,
however, and he still has other homework to do, so he leaves the site for another day.</p>

<div class="section" id="mary">
<h3>2.1.3. Mary<a class="headerlink" href="#mary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Mary, also a St. Basil Confirmation Candidate, has visited the website several times. When she logs in to the site she
sees the page with all the activities she has worked on with 100% next to the ones she has completed and some other
number indicating how much she has completed next to any she has started. She clicks on one that says 60% and goes
immediately to page four out of five. She has completed the other three.</p>
<p>But Mary isn’t happy with her answer to the previous page’s question so she clicks the “Previous” button at the bottom
left and goes to the preceding question. There she can edit her answer since it was an open-ended “what are your
thoughts” kind of question. Multiple choice questions cannot be changed because the correct answers are given jsut after
the candidates have submitted their response.</p>
<p>When she has edited her response she clicks the “Next” button to go back to page four and answers that question, a True
False type.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fr-jim">
<h3>2.1.4. Fr. Jim<a class="headerlink" href="#fr-jim" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As one of the administrators of the site, Fr. Jim has more choices than the candidates do. He can send out e-mails (to
which the other adults involved may also have access for safe environment purposes). Fr. Jim, and at least some of the
others also has access to a summary page of all the candidates activities. He can also comment on candidate responses
and perhaps send individual e-mails to that candidate when he has made a comment on his or her responses.</p>

<div class="section" id="thoughts-after-the-walkthroughs">
<h2>2.2. Thoughts After the Walkthroughs<a class="headerlink" href="#thoughts-after-the-walkthroughs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The main page seems simple enough to implement. A table should be able to hold the names of the activities and the
percent completed.</p>
<p>Each page will have the same header and footer which can be implemented as it has in my Christmas websites.</p>
<p>The challenge will be in the different kinds of activity pages. Somehow, each activity needs to know what kind of page
to display and have the right kind of content available for that kind of page. There should be a timing option so that
the time it takes the candidates to respond can be tracked and used if desired. Also, the aftermath of clicking the
“Submit” button may differ from page to page, or at least from one type of page to another. Pages requesting text
input should allow administrator comments, which closes that page for editing. Multiple Choice pages may optionally
give the correct answer once the candidates have submitted their response. All these differences will have to be
programmed in to the models somehow.</p>
<p>I think I have enough of an idea now to think about the database models I need to design. It will probably be much like
what I have already designed for the Christmas 2017 website.</p>

<div class="section" id="initial-thoughts">
<h3>2.3.1. Initial Thoughts<a class="headerlink" href="#initial-thoughts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I will need a User model which, in addition to the user name, e-mail and password will have to keep some information
on what the candidate has accomplished so far, where they stand in the various categories and perhaps even their
responses to each question. On second thought, much of that information can be kept in other models: who made a response
in a Response model, the time of entering and leaving timed pages for instance, but some things may still need to be
kept in a supplement to Django’s <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">auth.user</span></code> model.</p>
<p>There will need to be a model for the different types of pages: the instruction page, the text input page, the multiple
choice page. Some of these will have to have the ability to store usage dates and times corresponding to each user.</p>

<h3>2.3.2. Data Listing<a class="headerlink" href="#data-listing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A quick glance of Chapter 30 of <em>Django Unleashed</em> suggested, at least to me, that it might be helpful to simply list
the data that needs to be recorded without much concern as to models at the beginning. Here is an attempt to do that:</p>
